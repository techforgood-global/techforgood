# techforgood

Welcome! üëãüèæ

Thank you for visiting the tech for good community directory project repository, a directory of organisations driving tech for good and resources.


This document (the README file) is a hub to give you some information about the project. Jump straight into the sections below, or just scroll down to find out more. 


What are we doing and why? 
We at Tech for Good Global (powered by Bethnal Green Ventures) and others in the budding tech for good ecosystem get asked the question a lot about who else is out there supporting tech for good founders, non-profits, coops, individuals and providing essential funding to all types of companies and individuals from all walks of life. That‚Äôs why we embarked on this endeavour to list all the wonderful organisations fuelling the tech for good movement through funding, research, hands-on support, mentoring, and more. Please note this is work in progress, and whilst our ambition is global, we started small and list organisations we know well in the UK. Check out our contribution section to find out how you can get involved and help us make this list representative for all the organisations across the globe driving positive change for people and planet using tech. 


Who are we? 
We‚Äôre Tech for Good Global and we‚Äôre on a mission to grow the tech for good movement. Check out our website here.
